### Early Game: Guide
During the early game phase of the game, one of the best characters you should unlock is **Tom** because of his trait to add your click power. 

In this phase, the easiest achievement for you to unlock would be **Tom and Jerry** which involves the user having both a Jerry (which is unlocked by default) and a Tom. 

After unlocking Tom, it is recommending to progress into unlocking **Dog** due to its overpowered ability to gain points automatically. However, mandatory purchase of bones is required in order to keep **Dog** working (Bones can be purchased via *Buy Bones* Upgrade onec **Dog** is unlocked)

**Notes:** It is not recommended to Unlock **Grandma** this early due to its close-ranged attacks that would be less effective if Jerrys are not enough


### Mid-Game: Guide
After Unlocking **Grandma**, **Tom** and **Dog**, work your way into unlocking one of the two most powerful characters: **Godzilla** and **Bart Simpson**

**Godzilla**: Clear entire row of Jerrys after it's cooldown
**Bart Simpson** Clear every Jerrys after its cooldown

Unlocking these two characters woul dramatically increase your progress speed, allowing you to farm more points 

### End-Game: Guide
After unlocking all the characters, it is ideal to move on into unlocking the *Points Master* achievement set, which includes:

- *Points Master I*: Achieve 1 Million Points
- *Points Master II*: Achieve 10 Million Points
- *Points Champion*: Achieve 1 Billion Points

**Notes:**: Use and upgrade characters strategically, such as upgrading **Grandma** to the maximum to increase Jerry farming to another level

Other Achievements are also ideal to look into, such as:

- *Encylcpedia*: Unlock All Characters
- *Absolute Dedication*: Unlock All Achievements

After finshing these, you would finish the game as quickly and efficently as possible.
