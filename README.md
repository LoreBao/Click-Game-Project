## Intro

Welcome to **Click a Jerry**! In this game, your goal is to progress and unlock every upgrade and achievement.

**Target Audience/Players:** Users who enjoy short, fun minigames.

**Game Length:** 1–2 hours

---

## Quick Start

Your first step is to open the *Game* tab, launch your browser (Microsoft Edge recommended), and enter: [Link](https://LoreBao.github.io/Click-Project) to **enter the game**.

Next, locate a Jerry. Clicking it starts the game and gives you points for every Jerry click.

Find **Upgrades/Unlock** on the right side—this is where you unlock characters and upgrades. You’ll need enough points to perform certain actions, such as upgrading *Grandma* or unlocking *Godzilla*.

You’ll find the **Achievements** tab on the left. It’s optional but satisfying to unlock achievements. In your early game (first 15–20 minutes), the easiest achievement is **Tom and Jerry**, which requires **adding a Jerry** and **unlocking a Tom**.

---

## Controls and UI

**Click**
Use the *left mouse button* to click. Clicking a Jerry grants points based on **Jerry.reward**, which increases with the number of **Toms** you own.

**Score**
Displayed at the top-left; shows your total score.

**Characters Tab**
Located on the right; manage characters with actions such as:

* **Upgrade:** Improve character attributes.
* **Unlock:** Activate the character for future use.

**Side Screen**
Below the Jerry screen. This is where **Tom** and **Dog** are displayed once unlocked.

---

## Core Mechanism

**Game Cycle**
Click a Jerry to earn points. Each click yields points determined by **Jerry.reward**, which can be increased via **Toms**.

When adding a Jerry (**AddAmount Jerry**), there is a **25%** chance to summon a **Trap**. Clicking a Trap will **reduce your total points by 50%**!

Jerrys **respawn/randomize position every three seconds**. There is **no limit** to how many Jerrys can be on your screen. Increase the amount via the **AddAmount Jerry** upgrade.

Scores can be used for:

* Upgrade
* Unlock
* BuyBones
* IncreaseRange
* DecreaseCD
* AddAmount

Audio cues play for actions such as:

* Clicking a Trap: *scream.mp3*
* Achieving all achievements: *mango.mp3*

## Upgrade System

#### Consumables

*Bones* are the **only** consumable in Season 1. Consumables act as fuel for certain characters, such as **Dog**.

#### Automatic

Automatic characters/upgrades grant points automatically at set intervals or rates.

**Example**

* **Dog**

#### Destroyer

Destroyers clear Jerrys either **quickly with single-target** effects or **slowly with large-area (AOE)** effects.

**Fast, Single-Target**
**Grandma** rapidly randomizes positions to try to capture a single Jerry.

**Slow, AOE**
**Godzilla** and **Bart Simpson** have longer cooldowns but can clear entire rows or even the whole map—expensive but devastating.

### Dealer

A **Dealer** character boosts your point gain in different ways. The only Dealer in Season 1 is **Tom**. **Tom** increases your points per click based on how many **Toms** you own.

---

## Characters and Skills Explained

### Grandma

Automatically earns points when colliding with a Jerry while jumping around the map. Not recommended in early game due to the precision required.
**Recommended Use:** Late–end game when there are many Jerrys.

### Tom

Increases your points per click depending on how many Toms you own.
**Recommended Use:** Early–mid game when upgrades are expensive and manual clicking is your primary point source.

### Spike (Dog)

Automatically earns points for you, and the auto-gain amount is upgradable. However, **Bones** are needed to keep Dog working consistently. Purchase Bones via **Buy Bones**.
**Recommended Use:** Early–mid game when a steady point rate is needed.

### Jerry Upgrade

Increases the number of Jerrys on the map, making it easier to gain points via clicking or characters. However, each add has a **25%** chance to summon a Trap.
**Recommended Use:** Always—get it as soon as possible.

### Godzilla

Can be purchased for **700 points** and unlocked for **3,500 points**. After its **25s** cooldown, Godzilla clears an entire row of Jerrys.
**Recommended Use:** Late–end game when there are many Jerrys.

### Bart Simpson

Can be purchased for **3,000 points** and unlocked for **5,000 points**. After its **25s** cooldown, Bart Simpson clears the **entire map** of Jerrys.
**Recommended Use:** Late–end game when there are many Jerrys.

---

## Achievement System

There are many achievements to unlock. Your ultimate goal is to collect them all; each requires a different level of dedication.

* **Challenging:** **Points Series (I, II, Champion)** — requires commitment through early–mid game.
* **Beginner:** **Tom and Jerry** — only need to unlock Tom.
* **Medium:** **Encyclopedia** — less demanding than the Points Series, but requires time to unlock all characters.
* **Hardest:** **Absolute Dedication** — unlock all achievements.

## Beginner Tutorial Flow

### Early Game: Guide

Unlock **Tom** first for increased click power. The easiest early achievement is **Tom and Jerry** (have a Jerry—default—and unlock a Tom).

After Tom, it’s **recommended** to unlock **Dog** for strong automatic point gain. Note that **Bones** are **mandatory** to keep Dog working (purchase via **Buy Bones** once **Dog** is unlocked).

**Notes:** Unlocking **Grandma** this early isn’t recommended due to her close-range behavior being less effective with fewer Jerrys.

### Mid-Game: Guide

After unlocking **Grandma**, **Tom**, and **Dog**, work toward **Godzilla** and **Bart Simpson**—two of the most powerful characters.

* **Godzilla:** Clears an entire row of Jerrys after its cooldown.
* **Bart Simpson:** Clears all Jerrys after its cooldown.

Unlocking these two dramatically speeds up progress and farms more points.

### End-Game: Guide

After unlocking all characters, aim for the **Points Master** achievement set:

* **Points Master I:** Achieve **1,000,000** points
* **Points Master II:** Achieve **10,000,000** points
* **Points Champion:** Achieve **1,000,000,000** points

**Notes:** Use and upgrade characters strategically—for example, max **Grandma** to supercharge Jerry farming.

Other ideal achievements to pursue:

* **Encyclopedia:** Unlock all characters
* **Absolute Dedication:** Unlock all achievements

Complete these to finish the game as quickly and efficiently as possible.
